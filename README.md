# Coin-Collecting-Robot-STM32
Coin collecting robot programmed in C using an STM32 microcontroller <br>
Processor: ST Microelectronics, ARM, STM32F051 <br>
Project done as part of ELEC291 at UBC <br>
Design, build, program, and test robot that detects and picks coins.  <br>
The robot must operate within a predefined perimeter defined by a wire carrying an AC current. <br>
Robot uses a tank circuit to detect coins and an electromagnet to pick them up
